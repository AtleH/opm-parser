Keywords is the most important aspect of the ECLIPSE datafile
parser.

The structure of a keyword
--------------------------

A keyword contains from zero to many records, and each record contains
one or several items. Here comes three typical examples of keywords:


  GRID

  WCONHIST 
    ... /
    ... /
    ... /
  /

  EQLDIMS
    ....   /

  EQUIL
    .... /
    .... /

[ Each record is / terminated ]

In the list above here the GRID keyword has zero records, i.e. no data
attached. The WCONHIST keyword has three records of data, the EQLDIMS
keyword has one record and the EQUIL keyword has two records of
data. One of the first structural questions regarding keywords is how
many records they contain, this question is closely related to how the
keyword is terminated. When it comes to record size the keywords can
be split in three groups:

  1. Keywords with a fixed number of records. Both the GRID keyword
     and the EQLDIMS keyword have a fixed number of records, zero and
     one respectively. The keywords are therefor not explicitly
     terminated in any way.

  2. Keywords with a variable number of records.
